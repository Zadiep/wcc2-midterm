  <h1>Concept</h1>
  <p>Tattoo has gradually become a trend in young people. But choosing styles of tattoo always makes youngsters headache, especially for those who want to use special data as tattoo.

    Our team would like to design a website that can generate tattoos. Users can enter data that they feel are meaningful to them on the web page to generate random tattoos, which can be put on body parts to show the results.
    </p>

    <h1>Prototype</h1>
    <p>
      Prototype Link is here ->

  <h1>Process Reflection</h1>
  <p>
    Teamwork<br>
    <br>
    1.Divide whole progammet into stages<br>
    2.Get your team discuss together<br>
    3.One part one leader<br>
    4.How to collaborate on Github<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Technical<br>
    <br>
    1.Use html/css more proficiently<br>
    2.Learned the combination of html and p5.js code, and learned how to call the code we wrote in JavaScript from the web page[Xueyi]<br>
    3.Use the library of FaceMesh in Mediapipe[Yunxian]<br>

  </p>

  <h1>Iteration Outlook</h1>
  <p>
    User  experience :<br><br>
Users can enter more specific information (other than dates). More styles of coding tattoo for users to choose. <br>
The place which can display tattoo can be much more, face, body；<br>
The entire user experience can be better. E.g. the layout of the entire page can be clearer, and the response of each button，responsive design of the home page.<br>
<br><br>Code:<br>
<br>
CSS files should be separated. <br>
The generated exclusive tattoo pattern can directly appear in front of the camera, allowing tattoo coding to be combined with ml code.<br>
Data and user evaluation<br>
more data analysis and user feedback to adjust and improve the web design in time.<br>
